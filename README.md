# Keypress Surprise Exercise

This keydown exercise changes the numbered boxes to emojis when the user presses "1," "2," or "3" and clears the emojis when the user selects the "Clear" button.

## Objective

Use querySelector(), keydown events, a callback function, conditional statements and innerText to change the text to emojis, and a "Clear" button to revert it.
